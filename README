reperire
========

About
	Reperire performs LAN hostname discovery with other computers
	running it.  It keeps a SQLite database of the recent
	hostnames.  Then it dums them in the hosts file.  Becuase it
	needs to write to the hosts file, the program needs root
	access.

	It keeps the SQLite database and a log file in ~/.reperire.

	It only works on linux at the moment.  It almost works in OS X
	I have plans for it to work in Windows eventually.

Build
	`make`
	You need to have sqlite installed.  On ubuntu, the package is
	sqlite-dev.  Fedora uses sqlite-devel.  Gentoo uses
	dev-db/sqlite.

Installation
	`make install`

Running
	`reperire`
	OR
	`reperire&` to run it in the background

	At some point I will add an option for launching a daemon.

	I will make some init scripts eventually so it can start up
	with the system.

Stopping
	If it is running in the foreground, Ctrl-C will stop it
	gracefully.  
	If it is running in the background, `killall -INT reperire`
	will stop it gracefully.
