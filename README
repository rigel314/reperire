reperire
========

About
	Reperire performs LAN hostname discovery with other computers
	running it.  It keeps a SQLite database of the recent
	hostnames.  Then it dums them in the hosts file.  Becuase it
	needs to write to the hosts file, the program needs root
	access.

	It keeps the SQLite database and a log file in ~/.reperire.

	It works on linux and OS X.  I have plans for it to work in
	Windows eventually.

Build
	`make`
	You need to have sqlite installed.  On Ubuntu, the package is
	libsqlite3-dev.  Fedora uses sqlite-devel.  Gentoo uses
	dev-db/sqlite.

Installation
	`make install`
	If running this as root gives you errors, try
	`make install-executable`.
	
	You should also use this if you don't want init scripts
	installed.  This especially applies to OS X users.  
	`make install` installs a file that will cause reperire to
	start at boot.

Running
	`reperire`
	OR
	`reperire&` to run it in the background
	OR (if you are using an init script)
	`/etc/init.d/reperire start`

	At some point I will add an option for launching a daemon.

	Init scripts are now automaticaly installed with
	`make install`, however the init scripts can be found in my
	github wiki.  https://github.com/rigel314/reperire/wiki
	On OS X, `make install` installs a file that will cause
	reperire to start at boot.  

Stopping
	If it is running in the foreground, Ctrl-C will stop it
	gracefully.  
	If it is running in the background, `killall -INT reperire`
	will stop it gracefully.  
	If started through an init script, it should be stopped with
	`/etc/init.d/reperire stop`
